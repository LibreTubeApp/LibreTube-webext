# The LibreTube WebExtension

_Heavyly Work in Progress_

This extension will serve the following purposes:

- Configure your own instance URL in the extension options page
- Add "Watch in LibreTube" and "Subscribe in LibreTube" buttons when visiting YouTube channels/videos
- Add an option to redirect any and all requests for `youtube.com/watch?...` to `<your_instance>/watch?...`
